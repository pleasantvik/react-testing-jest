# TDD (Test Driven Development)

- Test driven development is a software developmemnt process where we write test before writing the software code.
- Software code are thus written to ensure the test pass

# TDD Phase

- 1. Create test that verifies the functionality of a specific features: Test will fail at this point
- 2. Write the code to ensure the test pass
- 3. Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the test continue to pass

- Note: TDD is also called red-green testing
